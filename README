minecraft-ctl
=============

This is a little wrapper for the minecraft server that makes it possible to
send commands to a minecraft server from the command line. This is usefull to
automatically and safely create world backups by sending the save-off command
before creating the backup and save-on after the backup is finished.


instructions
------------

1. Copy ctloptions.py somewhere (possibly into your minecraft server folder) and
   edit it as necessary. If it is not in your minecraft server folder be sure to
   set change the 'dir' setting to point to it.

   $ cp ctloptions.py /somewhere/minecraft/

2. Run minecraft with the folder where options.py is located as first
   argument. (or run it from that folder without arguments).

   $ minecraft /somewhere/minecraft/

3. Send commands to the server using "minecraft-ctl [<socket>] <command>". The
   control socket defaults to /tmp/minecraft-ctl if left out.

   $ minecraft-ctl say hello

   or

   $ minecraft-ctl /tmp/minecraft-ctl-2 say hello
